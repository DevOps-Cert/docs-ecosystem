REST Interfaces
---------------

Eve (Python)
~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Eve <http://python-eve.org>`_ is an open source Python REST API framework designed for human beings. It
allows to effortlessly build and deploy highly customizable, fully featured
RESTful Web Services powered by MongoDB.

The codebase is thoroughly tested under Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.3, 3.4 and PyPy.

All you need to bring your REST Web Service online is a MongoDB database, a 
configuration file and a launch script.  Overall, you will find that configuring 
and fine-tuning your API is a very simple process.

- Emphasis on REST
- Full range of CRUD operations
- Customizable resource endpoints
- Customizable, multiple item endpoints
- Filtering and Sorting
- Pagination
- HATEOAS
- JSON and XML Rendering
- Conditional Requests
- Data Integrity and Concurrency Control
- Bulk Inserts
- Data Validation
- Extensible Data Validation
- Resource-level Cache Control
- API Versioning
- Document Versioning
- Authentication
- ... and (a lot) more.

RESTHeart (Java)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`RESTHeart <http://www.restheart.org>`_ Java REST API server for
MongoDB, built on top of `Undertow <http://undertow.io>`_ non-blocking
HTTP server.  License: GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3.

- CRUD operations API on your data;
- Data model operations API: create databases, collections, indexes
  and the data structure;
- Super easy setup, with convention over configuration approach;
- Pluggable security with User Management and ACL;
- `HAL <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Application_Language>`_ hypermedia type;
- Super lightweight: pipeline architecture, ~6Mb footprint,
  ~200Mb RAM peek usage, starts in milliseconds;
- High throughput: very small overhead on MongoDB performance;
- Horizontally scalable: fully stateless architecture supporting
  MongoDB replica sets and shards;
- Built on top of `Undertow <http://undertow.io>`_ non-blocking HTTP server;
- Embeds the excellent `HAL browser
  <https://github.com/mikekelly/hal-browser>`_
  by Mike Kelly (the author of the HAL specifications);
- Supports `Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
  <http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/>`_ (CORS) so that your one-page web
  application can deal with RESTHeart running on a different
  domain. In other words, CORS is an evolution of `JSONP
  <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP>`_;
- Ideal as AngularJS (or any other MVW Javascript framework) back-end.
